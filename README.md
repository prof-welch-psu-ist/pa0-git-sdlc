# Git, the SDLC, and TDD

In this initial (half) programming assignment, you'll practice debugging, test driven-development, and generally working with git and the terminal. I recommend starting early on this in the event that you encounter process related issues -- such as commiting and pushing your work.

## Part 1: Test Driven Development (TDD)

In this first part, you'll practice: running tests, writing tests, identifying bugs using tests, and implementing bug fixes. 

First, `cd` into the directory where you are storing your work for 311 this semester, clone this repo, then open the cloned repo in IntelliJ. 

> If you want a video walkthrough of me doing this, check the Lesson notes regarding use of the terminal and git under Module 02 on canvas and/or consult the media gallery on canvas (which contains a recording where I give a sample).
